With the changes in cannabis regulations happening on October 17, 2018 across Canada, I wanted to share some thoughts with my community.

From my family law practice, I have had a front row seat witnessing how cannabis use and abuse can damage the lives of parents and children. I have seen relationships ruined and parents alienated from their children because of cannabis abuse and addiction. While there has been some modernization in the court’s view of medical use of cannabis, judges are also aware that cannabis is an addictive and dangerous substance that has the potential to take over people’s lives.

Legalization does not change the underlying science; cannabis is a dangerous product. If it is misused by a parent (like other dangerous but legal things such as alcohol, tobacco, band saws and rattle snakes) then there may be family law implications.

I am already busy enough, so please consider the above in the post-legalization Canada.

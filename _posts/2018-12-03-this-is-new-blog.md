Human rights lawyer Eric Letts has commenced a class action lawsuit on behalf of all parents and children subject to an Ontario child support order assigned to the Ministry of Community and Social Services or its agents.  The lawsuit seeks compensation to the parents and children for their diverted child support as well as human rights damages.

The Respondent is the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services. The class action is for breaches of the Ontario Human Rights Code and Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The allegations in the Application include that the Ministry’s policies and practices of requiring the assignment of child support is contrary to the Ontario Human Rights Code and equality and security provisions in Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Assignment of child support means that the Ministry receives the child support funds instead of a child or a parent. The Ministry currently requires disabled Ontarians and others who are in receipt of provincial assistance to assign their child support to the Province.

The class action seeks to recover back child support received by the Ministry and human rights damages.  To see if you are eligible, please contact us or read the requirements below:
